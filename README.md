### 📝 Project Overview

The dataset used in this project is focused on predicting **loan delinquency**, a critical metric in credit risk modeling. This EDA focuses on:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Missing value treatment
- Correlation and feature relationships
- Basic visualizations for data understanding

### 🔍 Key Highlights of EDA

- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation methods
- Used `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` for visualizations
- Analyzed numerical and categorical features separately
- Studied correlation between input features and delinquency outcome
- Identified data imbalance issues that may affect modeling
